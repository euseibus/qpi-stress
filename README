1.overview

    this is a tool to test CPU's QPI channel:

    start a process A and bind to cpu0, then request a share memory
    start a process B and bind to cpu1, then attach to process A's share memory
    process A write to the share memory, process B read from then share memory via QPI channel
    process A read the process B's share memory via QPI channel

         procA                   procB
          ||                      ||
        +------+              +--------+
        |cpu0  |  QPI channel | cpu1   |
        +------+              +--------+
          ||                      ||
